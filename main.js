/*
Write a function that takes an array of words and smashes them together into a sentence and returns the sentence. 
You can ignore any need to sanitize words or add punctuation, but you should add spaces between each word. Be careful, 
there shouldn't be a space at the beginning or the end of the sentence!

Example
['hello', 'world', 'this', 'is', 'great']  =>  'hello world this is great'
*/ 

//MY SOLUTION
function smash (words) {
  return words.join(" ")

It's a well known fact that anything Chuck Norris wants, he gets. As a result Chuck very rarely has to use the word false.

It is a less well known fact that if something is true, and Chuck doesn't want it to be, Chuck can 
scare the truth with his massive biceps, and it automatically becomes false.

Your task is to be more like Chuck (ha! good luck!). You must return false without ever actually using the word false...

Go show some truth who's boss!

Create a function that returns the CSV representation of a two-dimensional numeric array.

Example:

    [ 20,21,22,23,24 ],

Coding in function fiveLine, function accept 1 parameter:s. s is a string.

Please return a string of 5 lines(newline symbol is \n). The first line has one s; Second line have two s; and so on..Fifth line have five s;

Note1: The two sides of the parameter s may contain some whitespace, please clear them before using s.

Note2: Using a string template can make your job easier.

Example:

fiveLine("  a") should return "a\naa\naaa\naaaa\naaaaa"
a
aa
aaa
aaaa
aaaaa       <---The effect when you console.log it
fiveLine("  xy ") 
should return "xy\nxyxy\nxyxyxy\nxyxyxyxy\nxyxyxyxyxy"
xy
xyxy

Coding in function alienLanguage, function accept 1 parameter:str. str is a sentence.

We translate the sentence into an alien language according to the following rules:

Each word in the sentence is separated by spaces. The last letter of each word in the sentence 
turns to lowercase, and the other letters are capitalized. Looks very strange? Because this is the form of alien language ;-)

for example:

alienLanguage("My name is John") should return "My NAMe Is JOHn"
alienLanguage("this is an example") should return "THIs Is An EXAMPLe"
alienLanguage("Hello World") should return "HELLo WORLd"
A small hint: The first conversion of the entire string will make the code easier

Implement a function which accepts 2 arguments: string and separator.

The expected algorithm: split the string into words by spaces, split each word into separate 
characters and join them back with the specified separator, join all the resulting "words" back into a sentence with spaces.

For example:

splitAndMerge("My name is John", " ")  ==  "M y n a m e i s J o h n"
splitAndMerge("My name is John", "-")  ==  "M-y n-a-m-e i-s J-o-h-n"
splitAndMerge("Hello World!", ".")     ==  "H.e.l.l.o W.o.r.l.d.!"
splitAndMerge("Hello World!", ",")     ==  "H,e,l,l,o W,o,r,l,d,!"

should return 0; If there is no c in the str, should return -1. Retrieval should not ignored the case.

for example:
